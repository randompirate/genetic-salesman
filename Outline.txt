== 1 Create nodes
count = K
circle + noise
remove close ones


== 2 real TSP



== 3 genetic TSP

cost funtion = sum(distance(ni, ni+1)) + dist(n1, nk)

permute 0,_,k

normalise:
  always start with node 0

mutate:
  X - swap random nodes
  V - insert nodes back to front, front to back?      [Start with this]
  V - swap pairwise (combat crossing paths)           [End with this]
  ? - permute couple of final nodes

crossover:



== 4 intelligence:
  look for crossing path?
